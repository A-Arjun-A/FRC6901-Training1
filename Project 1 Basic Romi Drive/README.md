# Project 1 Basic Romi Drive

In this project, you will make the romi have an arcade drive (Moving the Left joystick vertically moves it forward and back, moving the right joystick horizontally turns it left and right) with an Xbox Controller. The drivetrain class is already implemented for you, all you have to do is:
1. Figure out out to use the Xbox controller
2. Use the Xbox controller to interface with the Drivetrain's `arcadeDrive` method.

## Video Demos + Tips
### Launching Simulation
This project comes with a simulation to help you debug this at home. [This video](https://youtu.be/Hww2kUTNgto) outlines the process for launching this simulation.

### Emulating your keyboard as an Xbox Controller
If its inconvenient to get access to an Xbox Controller to plug into your computer, you can set up the simulation so that your keyboard emulates the Xbox Controller. [This video](https://youtu.be/5PJP6-VLwk4) outlines this procedure.
