# Project 4.1 Basic Autonomous (Non-Commandbased)

In this project, you will make the romi move autonomously. You will make it move forward for 5 seconds.

You will be doing most of your code in the `autonomousPeriodic` method of `Robot.java`. You will probably want a variable that will help keep track of the time in some way.

## General Resources
Here is the documentation most relevant to helping you figure out how to do this:
- [Timer Docs](https://first.wpi.edu/wpilib/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/Timer.html)
- [FRC Example projects](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/examples-tutorials/wpilib-examples.html)
