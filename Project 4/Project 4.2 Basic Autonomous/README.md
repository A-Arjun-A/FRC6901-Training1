# Project 4.2 Basic Autonomous (Command Based)

In this project, you will make the romi move autonomously. You will make it move forward for 5 seconds.

You will be doing most of your code in the `RobotContainer.java`. You will want a command group that will make the robot start moving (look at some of the added methods/changes), then one to wait 5 seconds (wait Command), and then stop. 

## General Resources
Here is the documentation most relevant to helping you figure out how to do this:
- [Wait Command](https://first.wpi.edu/wpilib/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/command/WaitCommand.html)
- [Command Groups](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/command-groups.html)
- [FRC Example projects](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/examples-tutorials/wpilib-examples.html)
