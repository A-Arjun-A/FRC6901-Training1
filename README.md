### General Java Resources

Here are general resources for learning different concepts regarding Java. They are divided into three parts: Basic Fundamentals which covers the basic syntax and concepts regarding Java, Object Oriented Code which covers the important topics relating to Object Oriented programming in Java, and Advanced Java Concepts which covers additional concepts such as lambdas and design patterns.
#### Basic Fundamentals
- [Variables](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-java/lessons/learn-java-variables/)
- [Conditionals and Control Flow](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-java/lessons/java-conditionals-and-control-flow)
- [Switch Statements](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_switch.asp)

#### Object Oriented Code
